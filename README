This is experimental realisation of Dijkstra shunting yard algorithm of
translating arithmetical expression into polish notation. This is just a test
for me to study OCaml language.

In the folder tests you can find script "run_tests.sh" that launches my and the
wiki realisations of the algorythm on few eamples, compares the output and exits
if something is wrong
