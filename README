This is experimental realisation of Dijkstra shunting yard algorithm of
translating arithmetical expression into polish notation. This is just a test
for me to study OCaml language.

For compiling and launching program you can enter the following:


$ ocamlc str.cma toPolish.ml && ./a.out
1 + 2 + ( 4 + 3 )
